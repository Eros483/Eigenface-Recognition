# Eigenface Recognition with Python

This project implements eigenface recognition using Python, OpenCV, and scikit-learn. Eigenface recognition is a popular technique for facial recognition that uses principal component analysis (PCA) to identify and classify faces.

## Description

The project consists of several Python scripts:

- `eigenface_recognition.py`: This is the main script that performs eigenface recognition on a dataset of face images.
- `utils.py`: This script contains utility functions used by the main script.
- `attface.zip`: This zip file contains a dataset of face images used for testing the eigenface recognition algorithm. Make sure to extract this file before running the main script.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/Eros483/Eigenface-Recognition.git


2. Extract the `attface.zip` file containing the face image dataset.

3. Run the `eigenface_recognition.py` script:

python Eigenface_Recognition.py


4. Follow the prompts to test the eigenface recognition algorithm on the provided dataset.
